# Drone-Allocation-Application

## Installation Instructions:
As this Drone Allocation application uses an embedded SQL database, there is no need to install pip etc. You can simply run it using your chosen IDE.

## Information:
This application was created as a part of a university course. The drone allocation application basically allows users to help keep track of drones around certain areas of New Zealand. Within it, one can:
1. Create Drones and edit them.
2. Create Operators and edit them.
3. Allocate Drones to operators (and do validation checks to make sure that Drones are allocated to Operators who are not allocated to a Drone and have the correct Drone License).
4. View a Drone on a map.

All the saved data is stored in the attached MySQL database.
